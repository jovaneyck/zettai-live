# zettai

This repository contains a live-coded F# version of the Zettai TODO app, which is implemented in the book [From objects to functions](https://pragprog.com/titles/uboop/from-objects-to-functions/) by Uberto Barbini.
You can watch the video series on [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL8gDpwTEj4yICPadDHo9oA3HZ-XCf2KrD).

It aims to follow the broad outline of the book but to keep the code idiomatic F#. The [Giraffe](https://github.com/giraffe-fsharp/Giraffe) library provides a very similar experience to the [http4k](https://www.http4k.org/) library used in the Kotlin version.
